# Collections

A collection is a group of objects contained in a single object.

The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes in java.util for storing collections.

There are 4 main interfaces:
1. List - ordered collection, duplicates allowed
2. Set - doesn't allow duplicates
3. Queue - a collection that orders its elements in a specific order for processing
4. Map - a collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys allowed

A Deque is a sub-interface of Queue.
Map doesn't implement Collections interface.
